# Python Automation Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python-based automation projects developed over the past few years. Each folder represents a separate application built to automate practical tasks such as construction estimation, electricity billing, and consumption forecasting.

While these are not the exact versions developed during official job roles, they closely replicate the functionality, logic, and workflows used in the original projects.

## Projects Overview

1. BOQ Estimation  
Originally developed 4 years ago, this project automates the process of preparing Bills of Quantities for elect engineering tasks. It reads structured input data and generates detailed item-wise estimates to assist in cost planning and project documentation.

2. Electricity Billing System  
Based on a concept implemented 3 years ago, this application simulates internal electricity billing for departments based on sub-meter readings. It uses IESCO tariff structures to calculate departmental charges from a shared master meter, following standard utility billing logic.

3. Electricity Forecasting  
This project, conceptualized 2 years ago, predicts monthly electricity consumption for multiple feeders using historical usage data. It applies basic forecasting models to assist in energy usage planning and analysis.

## Folder Structure

Each folder contains:

- Complete source code
- Sample or placeholder datasets
- A dedicated README file with project-specific details

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for forecasting tasks)
- Streamlit (for UI components, where applicable)
- FPDF (for generating reports)

## Disclaimer

These implementations are simplified recreations of original workplace projects. All sensitive or proprietary data has been removed and replaced with dummy content strictly for demonstration purposes.
